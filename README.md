## Getting Started: FAQs

### What is React Native?
React Native is Facebook's solution to building native iOS and Android applications using JavaScript. It represents the first real attempt to bring web technologies to native mobile development. In the past, solutions like [PhoneGap][phone-gap] have used web-based solutions, which can be slow and unresponsive. With React Native's open source framework for building applications, you can build beautiful mobile applications.

### Why should I use it?
React Native is built on Facebook's belief that you should "build once, run everywhere." This means that, once you write your application using React Native, you will have both an iOS application and an Android application, which represents incredible time saving. 

In addition, React Native doesn't require to rebuild your application each time you make a change, meaning you can "refresh" the page just as you do in web development and see your changes.

Finally, JavaScript is a much more familiar and universal language than Objective-C. Now, you can harness the #skills you have from web programming and put them to use in creating awesome mobile applications, which are much more easily debuggable and stylable.

### What will this tutorial teach me?
This tutorial will teach you the basics of React Native. We will go through the basic concepts, ranging from React components, to Flexbox and styling, to running your application in XCode. It will NOT teach you all of the methods or possibilities of React Native. If you are interested in learning more in-depth material than this tutorial can offer, [examples][examples] are available, as well as all the [documentation][docs].

## Using this Document

This document contains a series of several sections, each of which explains a certain sector of our sample iOS application. In each section, we will add some code to our application. All of the code is available both in this document and in the GitHub repo available [here][github-link].
